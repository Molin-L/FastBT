# FastBT

This project is from a tech interview. I spent 1 day to write this demo. 
So obviously there are still many things I can do. 
And I found it's very valuable to create such C++ backtesting library. 

Here is how I prioritize features I need to implement.
1. Support stop order;
2. Refine price scale;
3. Improve the performance evaluation, maybe with some python plots.
3. Support margin trading;

Later I will add some diagrams to docs.
